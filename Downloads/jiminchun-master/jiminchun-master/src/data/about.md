# Intro

my mind still spitting
when the drums keep hitting
I was in a dark space
but Dilla brought me back
 
Thank J Dilla and for YouTube
for keeping me on track
Intact with reality
For being the remedy
 
cruising through life
without any license
living like a saint
dreaming in paint
 
go insane on a plane
eating my lo mein
not buying propane
need to try cocaine
 
I get kicks on my own
tricks are not shown
and my pockets are sown
Sylvester Stallone
 
what must be rhymed can't be grammar
flow like myanmar
kruger luger
stampede centipede
I am tired of not having a jobs
but I have decided to write
You cannot stay away from me jimi
I shall be the want that wake myself
I myself the ultimate salary
povidone to be preliminary
I am the canary
shame on you
for I am the thinner
meaner
side of dilla.
 
But Dilla brought me back
 
I made my mind to
share my thoughts
say my feelings
cause of you dilla
 
First to look for when I die
So I cannot go to hell
 
Please wish me well
Only in the afterlife
I choose to lose
 
Dilla brought me back
intact with reality
 
kay nine outshine
my life tupac
 
say mine
 
words are rhythm
language is rhythm
then you follow what makes your mind dance
follow the trials of your mind dancing
 
Copernius was right
days are long
and our time is right
 
say shit just to rhythm
rhythm is money
always running out money
starry nights within
 
 
Aion and Lions
Lying in babylon
she makes the milk
sing and the iris weep
the trees
are shaven with beer
rivers are crowned
men are sworn
albeit ransom shall be known
 
kingdoms fall and go
queens and kings are still made
ever so hastingly
reprimand the mantles
tying is on right
things are not seen
until they are within
side to chains are what binds us down
there were no river
boundy by shallow deeds
 
must I not see
the keeper of the might
and the sheer tears
of the bears
and the warbringers
of the juxtapose
jeers and cheers
are crowned each year
for they may finally see
from eye to eye
the nosebleed connection
is all that they ever needed
 
to survive in the flamery seeds the archetypes of the
weed cannot be in the night of the soul
 
we weep and cry until ed is gone
the starry night is what I might see tonight
heanes and bars
hells and swimming pools
welcome the angels and the bartenders
 
to see the teachers in toil
 
kids in vein
cherished in blood
sanguine red grape awesome
bourbon cheese cakes are thrown at their face
when none is shown. Children are made
each step of the way from prolonged death to the aion time they will never be a time when the goddess is right might see the time is ripe and see
 
I am the wonder oer of the worlds
the seerer oft eh sees the time of the time is
eevee shown here
 
in the pages of the newspapers the eyes will see
the mouth will water down the syndicates
 
of the aesthetic syndromes
 
that we seek
oh however you shalle
 
the freedom of the press is from the union
that beauty is dead
oh I thy cried in to the air
 
with no other beauty to witness
that beauty has perished
in the minds of the will
 
the anguish mob and social chromium
and chromosomes of electrical power and pproews.
 
river runs down the southern border
the of alps and the mexican drug king fish is the sauron thf the tree and night thwere smedjasd fhejfdskjtwrijf
 
chrom and kings
 
cheese and might
grass and hoppers
the stars nights
starry nights and starts
clash each night
 
it's sad to see that you don't know my worth
for I have thought you were goddess
as for I have had the king's eyes
 
 
For it is you that falls beneath me
and how shameful as I am who I know to be the most humble

Countless Pain I know in the world exists
but my music
is about the pain that I can feel
in which I can understand
that I am experiencing

I feel therefore I exist

I exist therefore I must art

To art I must thrive for excellence

For excellence I need to 

put in deliberate intention

deliberate intention in 

expressing myself

to express is to

꿈을 꿧어
On a coastline surroundbed by cafes that start with T
I walk a path trailed by a gay old couple men.

I reach down a slope and see Jiyoon
She tells me to 그만찝쩍거려

Just on my way back form 
sexually disagreed by 기쁨

But dilla snare is telling
me to go on

because life is a gift
and we are here to give

love a

FPC hiphop 12 is good

There are no weak or wack bars

With confidence no bar is weak or wack
With flow comes confidence in the mind
Whatever flows can never be wack


this is jumi's forest where animals are educated by the greatest
minds of animal kingdom to good forest (life)
how to make a good forest
educated they eat the excess stuff of forest

professor auntie for her what makes a good forest
is a forest that has clean air and a a lot of food
it is her duty to educate these animals
and make sure they become animals
that look good to the forest

tired but must go on to educate these kids
give them dream and hope ambition to become the best creature of the forest
But they dont see the forest

you are in the forest
this is a one big forest

numy wants to be accepted to birdland the forest for the free creatures
where you learn to fly higher to the sky where limits of science are testsed

jumy doesnt reallywant antyhing ormorel ike he is afraid. He questions back
those who askhim of his depression how can I want something that I dont want

It's hard to be happy by myself

but it is impossible with others....

감정으로 밀고 나가야하는게
내 머리속의 방식

앉아있어서 이루어진것 없어서
일어서ㅓㅅ 나갸아ㅑ하는것
이건 그냥 앉으면 
꿈처럼 이뤄저
이건 내 무으식
지능과 지성없이도 되지만
나ㅡㄴ ㄴ순수한 지성을 위해
이 것을 받치겠네

춤을 춰서

온 힘을 다하여 
내 생각을 하나 하나 씩
찍어 나가리
집중력과 고도의 힘
높은음 무지개
개울가 미치저던
속마음 에 잠궈버린
우무술속 비밀함
나는야 이시대 야만이
바보야 나같은 머리론 못살아
아저씨 쫌 봐줘요

바지락 칼국수
수비수 나이스
머리속 바이슨
더이상 수제비
하리수 나이스
머리숯 멋있어
속으로 떠있어
jiminchun
get some
아직은 다있어
장의사 칼있어
속으론 다있어

버스판 표지판
저절로 온다면 내게로 오게해

하기싫어도
끈기갖고 해왔어
